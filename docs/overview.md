## THE KEYS OF MEDOKH

THE EPIC STRATEGIC FANTASY CAMPAIGN RULE COMPENDIUM SUMMARY

Welcome to The Keys of Medokh, brought to you by Dynamic Games

### A brief history

Dynamic Games (Peter Read) purchased KoM from Alan Middleton in 1996.
It was to be a joint venture with each of us participating.
I have had no contact with Alan for over 3 years and consequently, the improvement and completion of the game has been slow.

The game is unfinished.
There is no magic.
I don't think the end game works.
Several features don't work.
Spell Research, the rules on Religion, and the detailed combat and siege rules are missing.
Also missing are most of the quick-reference tables and the extensive glossary of Medokhian terminology, together with some of the smaller background features such as Great Cities and Andaluziaks.
There are a lot of bugs and ommissions.
There are dozens of problems I haven't mentioned.
Changes will be made during the running of the game.
Some may disadvantage you.
When possible, if there is a problem, we will fix it or compensate you somehow.
If we can't, I'm afraid you'll just have to suffer the loss.

:::danger YOU WILL HAVE PROBLEMS!!

If you can't play the game under these conditions, please don't start.

:::

This document is the unofficial incomplete rule book.
It was typed in by a lady who knows nothing about the game and converted to html by someone who has very little time and even less expertise.
There is no 'Master Compendium'.
What you see is what we have, apart from the 'rule sheets' that are published occasionally and any changes we make to the doco.

:::caution This doco contains more lies than truths.

If something sounds too good to be true, it is too good to be true!
It will lead you astray more often than the devil himself.
If the book says it can be done, chances are it can't be done.
