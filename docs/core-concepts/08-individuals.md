# Individuals

There are over 130 different Individuals. The Medokh game system can actually cope with up to 200 different types,
however, so it is possible that another future new version release will expand on this aspect of the game even more: we
would welcome player suggestions for new Individual types at any time in the future, please just jot your thoughts down
on a scrap of paper and send it in. We won't be able to reply to everybody of course, but please rest assured that we
will definitely give every idea our full attention and consideration.

Most Individuals will be hired from the Malkahai-operated Open Market, which works almost exactly like the Open Market
for Manuscripts (detailed later), with Individuals going to the highest bidder and then teleported to the tribal
Capital. Several dozen different types of Individuals will be listed as available every turn, with between 1 and 8 of
each type up for grabs; a total of well over 100 differrnt Individuals. Each Type of Individual (eg. Master Farmers)
will be listed as a separate "Lot No." for bidding purposes, and each tribe may bid for 1 or more of those listed as
available. Each tribe may also bid for as many different types of Individuals as they wish, but this requires a separate
Order for each different type, as for Manuscripts. There is of course a Minimum Bid for each Type, and this will
increase most turns based on previous prices paid for that Type.

A brief description of each current basic type follows:

1. WARLORDS: A Warlord is your own character in the game, a combination of the Battle Captain, Weapons Trainer and
   Orator skills. However, the Warlord with which you start the game will also possess a single, very powerful skill in
   addition to the above "minor level" skills. Should this Warlord die you also get to play his or her successor, but
   second and subsequent Warlords will not possess the powerful skill, only the three minor ones. You may also rename
   your Warlord to suit personal tastes, should you so wish.
2. MAGIC USERS: Loremasters, Magicians and Sorcerers (ascending order of skill), count as multiple mystics, which
   masically means they're very powerful .
3. COMMANDERS: Battle Captains, Battle Generals and Battle Masters provide vaulable Leadership bonuses in combat, in
   addition to an Army's own Leadership, even if this is already 100%.
4. SIEGES: Siege Captains, Siege Generals and Siege Masters do something similar in siege situations, defensive or
   offensive.
5. TRAINING: Weapons Trainers, Weapons Instructors and Weapons Masters provide a significant boost when regiments are
   training.
6. POLITICS: Orators, Guild Orators and Master Orators make increasingly wonderful speeches for a variety of useful
   reasons.
7. HEALERS: An Apothecary, Guild Apothecary or Master Apothecary should not be overlooked as a valuable and welcome
   asset to the tribe.
8. GEM MINES: Surveyors, Guild Surveyors and Master Surveyors are invaluable for locating and operating Gem Mines.
9. EQUIPMENT: Armourers, Guild Armourers and Master Armourers are required to make real use of Practical Military Lore,
   or at least make it cheaper!
10. SPIES: Every race has its traitors who sell their services to the highest bidder. The best, the Master Spy, is of
    the Babulska and is therefore able to penetrate the settlements of any of the races, as the Babulska ARE
    everywhere (albeit in small numbers), but every settlement always has some.
11. ASSASSINS: As for Spies above. The Master Assassin is also of the Babulska, though like Spies there are Assassins of
    every race available.
12. TRACKER: Every race also has its terrain specialists. There are Trackers available for all the common terrain types,
    and all are of immense value to a campaign army in the field. A know-it-all Tracker is called a Master Ranger, and
    is usually also of the Babulska Clans.
13. CRAFTS GUILDS: All of the Common Lores are also represented by Guildsmen, thus such as a Master Farmer or Master
    Weaver (etc) may be hired to improve skills in the tribe. The Master Craftsman is a Master of ALL of the Crafts
    Guilds which come under this category, and a bit more.

## Individuals in New Campaigns

In new Version 111 campaigns all tribes begin the game with at least 7 Individuals, including a very powerful Warlord (
the player's own character), and a tribal Champion. The remaining Individual types very from tribe to tribe, but are of
course fairly much balanced. Further Individuals may be hired from Turn 1 onwards (up to a maximum of fifty per tribe),
with well over 100 new ones of various types becoming available for hire EVERY single turn -- but only to the highest
bidder.

Suffice to say, in Version 111 games Individuals will play an extremely important part of every successful
Warlord's strategy, at least of equal importance to military and economic strength. Indeed, the astute use of
Individuals will in many cases decide who wins - and who loses - a particular engagement, for there are few features in
the game where the use of Individuals does NOT make all the difference.

## Using Individuals

All of the Individuals are named (usually depending on their race, which will often be different to your own), and the
vast majority use their skills AUTOMATICALLY every turn where these apply. Thus a Master Farmer will always assist any
Corn Lore Upgrade Order for the settlement at which he's located, aid Corn Lore Research, and also will boost production
of Corn at his location, all without requiring an order to this effect.

There is a Supplementary Rules Sheet for every type of Individual, which you will receive when you first hire one of
that type. This will detail any specific Orders available to the Individual (eg. an Order is required for Assassins in
order to identify their targets, etc), where such might be necessary, but for most Individuals the new Version 111
Orders detailed later will prove more than sufficient.

Political and Military Listings on your Turn Results will show an "IND" heading with a Y or N for each settlement or
army beneath the heading: this indicates merely whether there are any Individuals located at that army or settlement,
but to find out exactly what types you would normally need to refer to the Individuals Listing itself.

The Individuals Listing should be self-explanatory except perhaps for where an Andaluziak Ranger is listed: its wage is
of course in Gemstones (and therefore is not included in the wages Total at the bottom of the Listing), and the figure
1-7 in parenthesis beside the wage is the Gem Type that the Andaluziak is paid in.
