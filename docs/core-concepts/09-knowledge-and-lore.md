# Knowledge and Lore

Various Orders may be found later in this booklet for compiling, duplicating, selling and transferring your tribe's
knowledge (ie. Researched Lore). In additon, any ancient Manuscripts discovered may also be copied and sold on the
Malkahai-operated Open Market for such, or may simply be transferred direct to any other player-controlled tribe via the
Malkahai, for which the Malkahai charge you a flat fee of around 150 Crowns.

A Manuscript of Knowledge (MOK) placed on the Open Market will be allocated a Lot Number and announced to all tribes,
for sale to the highest bidder on the next turn. A 'retainer' may be stated - the minimum amount you are prepared to
accept. The MOK copies up for sale do not leave your possession until actually sold - the Malkahai will collect them
when delivering payment from the successful bidder, and will then deliver them to the bidder. The Malkahai take a
commission for their services of 5% of the final sale price.

When you receive a MOK - whether bid for on the Open Market, transferred to you directly from another tribe, or found by
chance (such as by a party of tribal Adventurers exploring the ancient ruins of the land) - it will be instantly handed
over to your tribal scholars for study if it contains knowledge unknown to your tribe. If, for example, you receive a
100% Iron Lore MOK, your own Researched Level of Iron Lore will become 100% - although the MOK itself will be absorbed
by the scholars and placed in the tribal archives. But if you received two copies of the same Manuscript, only the first
would be 'absorbed' by your scholars - the second would be placed on your tribal Manuscripts Listing, as follows: Any
MOK's Compiled or Duplicated by your tribal Scholars, or that you receive from elsewhere but which are not of use to
your Scholars (because the tribe already possesses the knowledge contained therein) will be added to the tribal
Manuscripts Listing. Each Manuscript will have a unique MOK ID#, though multiple copies of an identical MOK will simply
be listed as 'copies' more than 1, rather than each have a different ID#. This ID# is used for indicating which MOK you
are referring to in an Order, such as Duplicating, Updating or Advertising For Sale Orders. An example of a tribal
Manuscripts Listing is shown below:

|ID|TYPE|LEVEL / REF|COPIES|
|--|----|----------:|-----:|
|1|Corn MOK|67|2|
|2|Leather MOK|59|1|
|3|Siege MOK|32|3|
|4|Legend|171|1|
|5|Meat MOK|72|2|
|6|Prophecy|239|1|
|7|Training MOK|13|1|
|8|Natural MOK|43|2|
|9|Spell Ritual|178|1|

Tribal Manuscript Listing

The difference between Level and Reference is fairly simple: if under Type, the Manuscript is one of the twelve Lore
types, then the value under Level is the Researched value that the MOK contains. But if under Type the Manuscript is
anything other than one of the twelve Lores, the figure under Level will be the Reference Number of that type. For
example, in addition to a Corn, Leather, Meat and Natural Lore normal MOK shown above, we also find a Legend (Ref#171),
a Prophecy (Ref#239), and three Special MOK's - namely one for advanced Siege Equipment (Ref#32), one for special
Training procedures (Ref#13) and one for a Spell Ritual (Ref#178).

Any Manuscript on your listing may be duplicated, advertised for sale, or transferred to another tribe directly. Lore
MOK's (Lore types 1-12) may also be Updated. However, it is important to remember that other than for MOK's containing
the twelve Lores, if you sell or otherwise lose possession of your last remaining copy of a special Manuscript, your
tribe will also lose the knowledge contained therein: you only have the ability to freshly compile ordinary Lore MOK's (
1-12), as this knowledge is known by tribal scholars, represented by your Researched Level of lore.
