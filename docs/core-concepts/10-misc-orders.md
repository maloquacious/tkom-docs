# Miscellaneous Orders

The term 'Miscellaneous Orders' is a throwback to the old days over five years ago when Medokh was still in infancy - at
that time there were only a small number of orders available and it was easier to separate them from Army moves by
simply lumping them all together under the term 'Miscellaneous'. These days the term is used to describe anything and
everything which does not directly involve Army Movement of one sort or another! However, for ease of reference we have
now broken down Miscellaneous orders under the subheadings of Military orders, Economic orders, Domestic orders,
Religious/Spell orders, and Individuals orders. Most Religious/Spell orders have been omitted from this document (but
are included in the Rule Compendium) as they are unable to be used in the early stages of the game.

Some orders are referred to as Special Miscellaneous orders, which is simply defined as something that usually causes
extra sheets to be added to your turn results, providing additional or more detailed information. Special Miscellaneous
orders incur a higher turn fee than ordinary Misc. orders, as set by your Moderator.

All Miscellaneous orders use a two or three-letter Order Code for describing the basic action being attempted, followed
by either one, two or three additional items of information dependent on the actual order being performed. Each item of
information should be entered on the Turncard as a separate parameter - see the section on Game Mechanics on page 8 of
this document. Other than the order Codes themselves, or when naming Towns or Armies, ALL other information entered on
the Order Sheet should be numeric. For example, where an order required you to enter a Common Commodity you should not
write 'Corn', you should use the ID number for Corn which is 3. An order to Buy Commodity 100 Kisels of Corn should
therefore look like this: BC 3 100 and with each item entered in its own parameter (box) on the Order Sheet.

---

## Orders Key

Note that hereafter we often use the hash (#) symbol. Where you see this mentioned in the order desceiption, it means
you need to enter an ID number of some sort in that parameter. For instance, if an order parameter requires a 'Town#' it
means enter the relevant Town's unique ID number in this parameter, from your Turn Results 'Political' listing.

A number of orders will be shown with some items in (brackets) and some items in [parenthesis]. The difference is
that [parenthesis] items are optional - leave blank if not used - but items in ordinary (brackets) are compulsory and
something must be entered for the order to work properly. The first two orders below, BC and SC, are examples of the
difference.

Mention will also often be made of a particular order failing if there is a 'Hostile' army nearby (and sometimes even if
just Neutral). In all cases this also means if YOUR tribe is declared Hostile (or Neutral) to their tribe, even if they
are not quite Hostile in return. In other words a state of war exists between two tribes if just one is Hostile to the
other, and it is this state of war which will prevent some orders from being performed, regardless of which side is
actually Hostile to the other.

And finally, a general rule: wherever an order reference is made to a TOWN# this also means any CITY (which the game
system defines as simply a very large town). However, where CITY is specifically stated this excludes any ordinary
Towns.

---

## Economic Orders

The Economic orders available at the start of the campaign are limited in number but extremely important. With these you
may levy taxes on your Towns and Cities to produce common commodities and gold Crowns; surplus commodities may be sold
to the Malkahai for cash; and commodities in short supply may be purchased.You may also invest in the volatile trade in
precious commodities - the buying and selling (and later perhaps, actual mining?) of valuable Gemstones. And last but by
no means least, you may also give commodities or gold Crowns to virtually any other tribe in the campaign, earning
potentially-valuable Influence in doing so. The basic Economic orders available are as follows:

|Common|ID|Precious|
|------|-:|--------|
|Iron|1|Pearls|
|Stone|2|Jade|
|Corn|3|Emeralds|
|Leather|4|Sapphires|
|Wood|5|Rubies|
|Cloth|6|Amber|
|Meat|7|Diamonds|

Commodity Table

---

## BUY COMMON COMMODITY

BC ( Type# 1-7 ) ( Quantity ) [ Price ]
Example: BC 3 100 7
to buy 100 Kisels of Corn, paying no more than 7 Crowns per Kisel.
SELL COMMON COMMODITY
SC ( Type# 1-7 ) ( Quantity ) [ Price ]
Example: SC 5 300 5
to sell 300 Kisels of Wood, selling for no less than 5 Crowns per Kisel.
The Order Codes above are for Buy Commodity and Sell Commodity respectively. In the 2nd parameter enter the number which
corresponds with the Commodity that you wish to buy or sell, and in the 3rd parameter enter the number of Kisels (units)
of this type to buy/sell. To buy or sell at current market prices (or thereabouts) leave the 4th parameter blank, but if
you wish you may insist on a maximum price you'll pay when buying and a minimum you'll accept when selling: do not
exercise this option unless the transaction is unimportant!

At the start of the game, prices will be around 10 crowns per kisel to buy, slightly less if you are selling, but as the
game develops they will fluctuate with supply & demand. All trading with the BC & SC orders is automatically conducted
with the remnanats of an ancient race known as The Malkahai. Trading takes place very early in the month (Turn) so you
may buy commodities you'll need on the same turn, or sell surplus commodities to raise any cash you might need urgently.

---

## BUY PRECIOUS COMMODITY

```text
BP ( Type# 1-7 ) ( Quantity ) [ Price ]
```

    Example: BP 2 5 120

to buy 5 pieces of Jade, paying no more than 120 Crowns per piece.

---

## SELL PRECIOUS COMMODITY

```text
SP ( Type# 1-7 ) ( Quantity ) [ Price ]
```

    Example: SP 7 9 185

to sell 9 Diamonds, selling for no less than 185 Crowns per stone.

The Order Codes above are for Buy Precious and Sell Precious respectively. In the 2nd parameter enter the number which
corresponds with the Precious Commodity that you wish to buy or sell, and in the 3rd parameter enter the number of
pieces (stones) of this type to buy/sell. To buy or sell at current market prices (or thereabouts) leave the 4th
parameter blank, but if you wish you may insist on a maximum price you'll pay when buying and a minimum you'll consider
when selling: do not exercise this option unless the transaction is unimportant! At the start of the game, prices will
be around 100-200 crowns per piece to buy, slightly less if you are selling, but as the game develops they will
fluctuate with supply & demand. All trading with the BP & SP orders is automatically conducted with the remnants of an
ancient race known as The Malkahai .

In the early stages of the game they are worth stockpiling unless you are *DESPERATE* for the cash. Andaluziakian
Rangers love gems. A pile of at least 50 should attract them.

---

## GIVE TRIBUTE

```text
GT ( Tribe# ) ( Crowns ) [ Msg# ]
```

Example: GT 13 5000 2

to send 5,000 Crowns to Tribe # 13, enclosing Message # 2.

This order allows you to send God Crowns from your Treasury to another Tribe.

This will be handed over to Malkahai traders to be passed on, for which they will charge you a fee equal to 5% of the
total value. If you wish you may also send one of a choice of brief messages using the optional fourth parameter of the
order, from the list below:

|Code|Meaning|
|---:|-------|
|1|A gift, with no strings attached|
|2|A gift, hoping for friendship|
|3|A gift, please leave me alone!|
|4|A loan, repay when able to|
|5|A loan, repay as agreed|
|6|Payment for goods as agreed|
|7|Payment for services rendered|
|8|For services yet to be rendered|

Transferring Gold Crowns to another tribe will earn you Influence with the people of the receiving tribe. If sufficient
Gold is sent it could turn a hostile enemy Neutral, or encourage a neutral kingdom to Parley with you. A Parleying
kingdom might even be persuaded to declare their Alliance with your people.

You may transfer Gold Crowns to any of the 42 player tribes (ID's 1-42) and also to any of the following:

|Code|Tribe|
|---:|-------|
|43|Malkahai|
|45|Centaurs|
|46|Drow|
|47|Rock Trolls|
|48|Ogres|
|49|Minotaurs|
|50|Dryads|
|51|Independent Humans|
|52|Independent Elves|
|53|Independent Dwarves|
|54|Independent Orcs|
|55|Independent Kobolds|
|56|Independent Hobbits|
|57|Babulska|

Tribes 44 (Undead Mazdrakians) and 58 (Evil Curazck) may not be transferred Gold Crowns.

---

## GIVE COMMON COMMODITY

```text
GC(Tribe#)(Type#)(Quantity)
```

    Example: GC 13 4 250

to send 250 Kisels of Leather to Tribe #13.

This order allows you to send an amount of any Common Commodity from the Tribal stockpiles to another Tribe. This will
be handed over to Malkahai traders to be passed on, for which they will charge you a fee equal to 5% of the total market
value of the goods in question.

Transferring Commodities to another tribe will earn you Influence with the people of the receiving tribe: see pages
19-22 for full details.

You may transfer Commodities to any of the 42 player tribes (ID's 1-42) and also to any of the following:

|Code|Tribe|
|---:|-------|
|43|Malkahai|
|45|Centaurs|
|46|Drow|
|47|Rock Trolls|
|48|Ogres|
|49|Minotaurs|
|50|Dryads|
|51|Independent Humans|
|52|Independent Elves|
|53|Independent Dwarves|
|54|Independent Orcs|
|55|Independent Kobolds|
|56|Independent Hobbits|
|57|Babulska|

Tribes 44 (Undead Mazdrakians) and 58 (Evil Curazck) may not be transferred Commodities.

The Malkahai will not transfer Precious Commodities (Gemstones) on your behalf, only Common Commodities. They have never
offered an explanation.

---

## DECLARE TAX LEVY

```text
TL ( Town# ) ( 0-10 ) [ 0-2 ]
```

    Example A: TL 3 5 [0 ]

to change the Tax Levy of Town #3 to Level 5.

    Example B: TL 3 5 1

As above Example A but including all Towns & Cities in the same Region as Town #3.

    Example C: TL 3 5 2

As above Example A but including all Towns & Cities belonging to your tribe, wherever located.

Every Town and City belonging to your tribe may be taxed to add commodities to the tribal stockpiles and Crowns to the
Warlord's Treasury. Each settlement may be taxed individually: for every 1 level of taxation you will take 10% of a
farmer's surplus production and 10% of a merchant's profits. 'Surplus' production/profit is what remains after the
farmer/merchant has provided the basic necessities for himself and his dependants, so if you tax a town at level 10 you
would be taking 100% (ie. all) of their surplus production/profits.

Most citizens generally accept a tax level of 5 - giving 50% of their surplus to the tribal stockpiles & Treasury. A tax
level lower than this would boost morale and encourage growth in the settlement, whilst a tax level higher than 5 would
have the opposite effect. A newly constructed town would have a tax level of zero - and the longer you leave this low
the quicker the town will be populated.

Example A above shows the basic order with which you may levy taxes on a single specified settlement, in this case a
level 5 on Town #3. Leaving the fourth [optional] parameter blank, or putting a zero, limits the effects of this order
to just the single, indicated town. However, there are two additional options available for larger tribes, as follows:
Example B above again shows Town #3 being given a tax levy of level 5, but in this case there has been an additional
option utilised - the figure 1 in the fourth parameter. This indicates that the new Tax Levy of 5 is not restricted to
just Town #3, but that it is to be extended to include all towns and cities located in the same Region of Medokh's
World. This 'Regional' order is useful for larger tribes later in the game as it saves you from having to issue multiple
Tax Levy orders, one for each individual settlement.

Example C is similar to B but in this case there is the figure 2 shown in the fourth parameter of the order. This is an
instruction to ALL towns & cities belonging to your tribe - wherever they might be located - to change their Tax Levy to
the level indicated in the order.

---

## DOMESTIC ORDERS

Domestic orders in the campaign are generally concerned with the day-to-day management of your population centres - your
Towns and Cities - and of the civilian aspects of your tribe in general. Knowledge ('Lore') is the cornerstone of any
great power in the land, and therefore the use and abuse of Lore is the main feature of this section: most Domestic
orders involve the discovery and implementation of Lore in one form or another, but also included are some general
Domestic orders useful at this stage in the campaign.

---

## RELOCATE TO NEW CAPITAL

```text
NC ( Town # )
```

    Example A: TL 3 5 [0 ]

    Example: NC 7

To relocate the tribal Capital to Town/City ID Number 7, from wherever it's located at present.

With the above order you may relocate the tribal Capital, naming a Town or City to be regarded as the new Capital in
future. The Capital is the financial and administrative centre of your growing kingdom and also contains a large
proportion of the tribe's wealthiest and most influential families. The tribal archives are also located within the
capital, as are its stocks of precious Gemstones - though Common Commodity stockpiles and gold Crowns in the Treasury
are spread throughout the tribe, stored within towns & cities.

This order may be performed whether or not you have an existing Capital (ie. it might recently have been captured by an
enemy force) but the longer your people are without a Capital the more their morale will suffer in general. A Town or
City stripped of its prestigious position as the Capital of the tribe would not be particularly happy with the idea, but
the populace of the new Capital would doubtless be very happy. As a general rule, it is not usually worth relocating
your Capital unless it is severely threatened.

The Capital may not be relocated at all if either the existing one or the proposed new site have a non-allied force in
the same or an adjoining hex location.

---

## NAME TOWN

```text
NT NT ( Town# ) ---- ( New Name )
```

    Example: NT 1 ---- Birchdale Lodge

To rename Town #1 'Birchdale Lodge'.

All Towns and Cities (& Armies) in the campaign are given a name when first established, but settlements often change
hands as a result of sieges and conquest and it would be unseemly for some noble Elven tribe to possess a Town with, for
instance, an Orcish name. This order is provided to enable you to rename your captured settlements accordingly. Note
that the new name may not consist of more than 30 characters, including any spaces. The name itself should be neatly
printed in the fourth, not third parameter of the order space (please leave the third parameter blank).

---

## ABANDON SETTLEMENT

```text
AB ( Type# ) ( Settlement# )
```

Types are:

|Code|Meaning|
|---:|-------|
|1|Town or City|
|2|Fort, Gem Mine or Wizard's Tower|
|3|Shrine|

    Example A: AB 1 5 ---- To abandon Town/City #5.

    Example B: AB 2 5 ---- To abandon Fort/Gem Mine/Tower #5.

    Example C: AB 3 5 ---- To abandon Shrine #5.

This order may be used to Abandon any controlled settlement, provided no non-allied force is present in the same or an
adjoining hex location. The settlement is totally destroyed in the process and roughly half of the construction
materials will be regained and added to tribal stocks, including any materials used for additional defences above fort
level 2.0.

---

## CIVILIAN REINFORCEMENT

```text
CR ( Town# ) ( Fort Lvl. )
```

    Example: CR 1 8.5

To reinforce the defences of Town/City #1 up to Fortification Level 8.5.

With this order you may employ local civilian builders, craftsmen and labourers to improve the fortification level of
their own Town or City: remember that Towns have a maximum possible Fortification Level of 12.0, and Cities 15.0.

For every FULL 5% population resident in the settlement at the start of the month, you may assume they have the
equivalent 'build strength' of 1 regiment performing the order, as shown on your 'Race Reference Card' under the
heading 'Reinforcing Defences'. Your Turn Results will show you what percentage of the settlement's skilled civilians
were involed in the order, and it is worth noting that a skilled Siege Captain, Siege General or - preferably - Siege
Master, are all capable of improving performance of this order if located within the settlement itself at the start of
the Turn.

Civilian Reinforcement will use the same quantity of materials as would ordinary reinforcement by a Field Army, but the
skilled civilian labour will demand payment for their services equal to THREE TIMES the wage of normal regiments doing
the same amount of work: unpaid civilians will refuse to work. The advantage of Civilian Reinforcement, of course, is
that the labourers are always on hand locally and do not have to be marched here specifically.

Civilian Reinforcement is not possible if a Hostile army occupies the same or an adjoining location at the start of the
month, nor is it possible to use the CR order at any Shrine, Fortification, Gem Mine or Wizard's Tower.

---

## MASS PROPAGANDA

```text
MP ( Tribe# ) ( 101, 102 or Tribe# ) ( Crowns )
```

    Example A: MP 14 101 15000

To spend 15,000 Crowns encouraging your own people to be more friendly towards Tribe #14.

    Example B:MP 30 102 20000

To spend 20,000 Crowns urging your own people to be more Hostile towards Tribe #30.

    Example C:MP 30 14 25000

To transfer 25,000 Crowns to Tribe # 14 urging the people of that Tribe to be more Hostile towards Tribe # 30.

See the section on Tribal Relations and Population Influence, pages 19-20.

The Mass Propaganda order is primarily used to change Tribal Influence, to make your people either more friendly or more
hostile towards another tribe. It may also be used to try to turn another tribe against a third tribe. Examples of all
three uses are shown above: Example A above ('101' in the third parameter) is to attempt to make your people friendlier
toward the tribe given in the second parameter of the order.

Example B above ('102' in the third parameter) is to attempt to turn your people against the tribe mentioned in the
second paramater.

Example C above (another tribe number in the third parameter) does not involve your own people at all. In this case the
gold Crowns indicated in the fourth parameter of the order will be transferred to the Treasury of the tribe given in the
third parameter, in an attempt to influence them against the tribe detailed in the second parameter. Only Despots can
ignore their people with impunity - a Monarchy would suffer morale loss for ignoring his people's wishes, and a Republic
will automatically declare Diplomatic Attitudes towards other tribes in keeping with the opinions of the ordinary people
of the Republic. See pages 7, 19-21.

---

## RESEARCH LORE

```text
RL ( Lore # 1-10 ) ( Crowns )
RL ( Lore # 11-12 ) ( Gem # 1-7 ) ( Gems )
```

Lore Types are:

|Code|Meaning|
|---:|-------|
|1|Iron Lore|
|2|Stone Lore|
|3|Corn Lore|
|4|Leather Lore|
|5|Wood Lore|
|6|Cloth Lore|
|7|Meat Lore|
|8|Military Theory Lore|
|9|Practical Military Lore|
|10|Natural Lore|
|11|Lesser Mysteries|
|12|Greater Mysteries|

Gem Types are:

|Code|Meaning|
|---:|-------|
|1|Pearl|
|2|Jade|
|3|Emerald|
|4|Sapphire|
|5|Ruby|
|6|Amber|
|7|Diamond|

    Example A: RL 6 3000

To spend 3,000 gold Crowns researching Cloth Lore.

    Example B: RL 11 4 300

To spend 300 Sapphires researching the Lesser Mysteries.

As you can see above, there are two types of Lore Research, with lores 1-10 requiring expenditure in gold Crowns but
lores 11 & 12 requiring the consumption of precious Gemstones (one type per order issued). The practical effects of Lore
Research vary, and are as follows: Lores 1-7 are the seven 'Common Commodity' Lores and each may be researched up to
100%. Towns and Cities may be Upgraded in each of these Lores to boost production of the relevant commodities.

Lore 8, Military Theory, may also be researched up to 100%. Town and City garrisons and Field Armies may have their '
Leadership' value Upgraded if this is lower than the current Researched Level of Military Theory. Leadership is
important in combat situations.

Lore 9, Practical Military Lore, may also be researched up to 100%. Town and City garrisons and Field Armies may have
their 'Lore' value Upgraded if this is lower than the current Researched Level of Practical Military Lore. Lore is
important in combat situations.

Lore 10, Natural Lore, is a general lore, and as you Research this knowledge up to 100% it will soon spread out among
your people without the need for Upgrading anywhere. Your Researched Level of Natural Lore will automatically affect a
great many things among your people.

Lore 11, the Lesser Mysteries, is the odd one out as this may be researched up to 700% - up to 100% in each of the seven
types of precious Gemstones. Lesser Mysteries is necessary for successful Spell Research later in the campaign, among
other things.

Lore 12, the Greater Mysteries, will prove the most expensive Lore to research and like the Lesser Mysteries also
consumes Gemstones. However, unlike the Lesser Mysteries, any combination of any Gemstones may be used to research the
Greater Mysteries (even using just one type of Gemstones, if preferred).

---

## UPGRADE ARMY

```text
UA ( Army# ) ( Lore 8-9 ) ( Crowns )
```

    Example A UA 1 8 5000

To Upgrade Military Theory ('Leadership') of Army #1, spending 5,000 Crowns

    Example B: UA 1 9 5000

To Upgrade Practical Military Lore of Army #1, spending 5,000 Crowns

Armies may be Upgraded only when they begin the Turn located at a Town or City belonging to either your tribe or a
mutual ally, where appropriate civilians are present to accomplish the order: Army Upgrades cannot take place at any
other type of settlement. This order does not prevent an Army from doing anything else on the same turn.

When upgrading at one of your own settlements your Army may be Upgraded as high as your own tribe's Researched Level in
the appropriate Lore, but whenUpgrading at an ally's settlement the limit is their Researched Level. In addition, any
Armourers, Guild Armourers or Master Armourers present in your ally's settlement when upgrading your Army in Practical
Military Lore (#9) will aid the order and provide increased gain for no extra cost, just as your own Armourers would if
upgrading at your own settlements. The same applies to local Battle Captains, Battle Generals and Battle Masters when
upgrading in Military Theory (#8).

If an allied tribe Upgrades their Army at one of your settlements you will be paid taxes on the money your people
receive from the allied commander for their services, in recognition of the extra trade you've provided for the
settlement's craftsmen (Lore #9) or scholars (Lore #8). This tax will be at the standard rate for that settlement - eg.
a Tax Levy of 5 will mean you would receive about 50% of all the Crowns your allies spend on Upgrading their armies at
your settlement. As upgrading large armies significantly is a very expensive undertaking, it can be seen that here lies
a very profitable opportunity awaiting exploitation by some enterprising Warlord.

---

## UPGRADE GARRISON

```text
UG ( Town# ) ( Lore 8-9 ) ( Crowns )
```

    Example A: UG 1 8 5000

To Upgrade Military Theory ('Leadership') of the garrison troops at Town #1, spending 5,000 Crowns

    Example B: UG 1 9 5000

To Upgrade Practical Military Lore ('Lore') of the garrison troops at Town #1, spending 5,000 Crowns

Only the garrisons of Towns and Cities may be Upgraded, not any other settlement types, as this is where the necessary
civilians are located.

Note that mustering Guard to Garrison would usually have the effect of reducing the Garrison's 'Leadership' and 'Lore'
levels as the new regiments will have lower ratings, which are then averaged with the ratings of the existing garrison
regiments to produce a new overall rating. Garrisons should therefore periodically by upgraded in both the Military
Lores.

---

## UPGRADE LORE

```text
UL ( Town# ) ( Lore 1-7 ) ( Crowns )
```

    Example: UL 1 5 5000

To Upgrade Wood Lore at Town #1, spending 5,000 Crowns

Lore Types are:

|Code|Meaning|
|---:|-------|
|1|Iron Lore|
|2|Stone Lore|
|3|Corn Lore|
|4|Leather Lore|
|5|Wood Lore|
|6|Cloth Lore|
|7|Meat Lore|

Every Town and City has a rating between 0-100% for each of the seven Common Commodity Lores. Once the tribal Researched
Level for a Lore is higher than a Town's corresponding Lore level, the latter may be Upgraded with this UL order.

A Town's Lore level may never exceed the Researched Level.

Increasing a Town's Lores has the effect of increasing civilian production of the relevant commodities every month. See
pages 5 and 22.

---

## CONCENTRATED UPGRADE

```text
CU ( Town# ) ( Crowns ) [ Not Lore# ]
```

    Example: CU 1 5000 5

To spend 5,000 Crowns upgrading all Lores at Town #1 except Wood Lore The Concentrated Upgrade order is provided for
when the tribe is wealthy enough to not have to be too selective when it comes to upgrading Town Lores.

The CU order will go through each of the indicated Town's Lores in turn (on a racial-preference basis) and attempt to
Upgrade each Lore to the current Researched Level. It will end either when all Lores have been upgraded to the maximum
or when it has spent all of the Crowns allocated to the order.

Using the fourth parameter of the order space you may enter a Lore Type # (1-7) which is not to be included in the
Upgrade process. This would usually be due to poor production of that commodity in the local terrain - for instance,
Plains produce very little Iron. This is entirely optional, so if left blank all seven Lores will be Upgraded providing
sufficient cash has been allocated.

---

## GLOBAL UPGRADE

```text
GU (Lore# 1-7) (Crowns) [Terrain# 1-6]
```

    Example: GU 3 5000 1

To Upgrade Corn Lore in all Towns & Cities located in Plains, spending 5,000 Crowns in total.

Terrain Types are: 1 = Plains 2 = Forest 3 = Mountains 4 = Hills 5 = Forested Hills 6 = Wastelands This order will go
through each Town and City in numerical order and, using the allocated Crowns until exhausted, will attempt to Upgrade
the indicated Lore type in each settlement up to the current Researched Level. If a Terrain type is indicated in the
fourth parameter it will only attempt to Upgrade settlements located in this terrain - leave blank if you wish to
Upgrade this Lore in all settlements regardless of location.

---

## COMPILE MANUSCRIPT

```text
CM (Lore 1-12) (Copies) [Level]
```

    Example: CM 3 5 75

To compile 5 copies of a Corn (#3) Manuscript of Knowledge, each one containing a Lore level of 75%.

Lore Types are:

|Code|Meaning|
|---:|-------|
|1|Iron Lore|
|2|Stone Lore|
|3|Corn Lore|
|4|Leather Lore|
|5|Wood Lore|
|6|Cloth Lore|
|7|Meat Lore|
|8|Military Theory Lore|
|9|Practical Military Lore|
|10|Natural Lore|
|11|Lesser Mysteries|
|12|Greater Mysteries|

Further to the section on the tribal Manuscripts Listing (see page 35), with this order you may Compile 1 or more copies
of a Manuscript of Knowledge containing tribal Lore up to the current Research Level for such. The first copy requested
will cost 25 crowns x (Lore Level contained) to produce - ie.

2,500 Crowns to produce a MOK containing 100% knowledge of any Lore. Additional copies would cost 5 Crowns x (Lore
Level) each. Usually this order would create MOKs containing a level of knowledge equal to the current Research Level of
this Lore, but if you wish you may use the optional fourth parameter to indicate a lower Lore level than that known -
eg. 75% even though Lore might be at 100%.

You may not, however, specify a higher Lore than your tribe's current Research Level.

New MOKs will be added to your tribal Manuscripts Listing (where they will receive a unique ID# for future reference)
and may then later be Updated, Duplicated, Advertised for sale on the Open Market, or transferred directly to another
tribe.

---

## DUPLICATE MANUSCRIPT

```text
DM (Manuscript ID#) (Extra Copies)
```

    Example: DM 6 3

To produce 3 more copies of Manuscript ID# 6.

With this order you may produce additional copies of an existing Manuscript from your tribal Manuscripts Listing.

Any Manuscript in your possession may be duplicated, not just MOKs containing one of the twelve Lores. The cost per copy
for doing so is 5 Crowns x (Current Lore Level) for MOKs (Lores 1-12), and a flat rate of 500 Crowns per copy for any
other type of Manuscript, such as one containing a Spell Ritual or ancient Legend.

---

## UPDATE MANUSCRIPT

```text
UM (Manuscript ID#) [New Level]
```

    Example: UM 6 85

To Update all existing copies of Manuscript #6 to now contain 85% Lore.

This order is used when you have copies of a normal MOK (Lores 1-12) which now document less knowledge than your new
Research Level in that Lore type, and which you therefore wish to simply Update rather than create anew. If you wish you
may use the optional third parameter to specify an exact level of Lore should you not wish to Update quite as high as
the current Research Level: if you leave this parameter blank the order will attempt to Update right up to the current
Research Level.

The cost of Updating existing Manuscripts is based on the degree of work involved; ie. the difference between the Lore
level which the MOK currently contains, and the level to which it is to be Updated. For instance, if the MOK contains
Corn Lore at 50% and your Research Level is now 70%, the cost is based on the difference between the two, of 20%. For
the first copy being Updated the cost is Difference x 25 Crowns, and for additional copies Difference x 5 Crowns.

However, it is important to note that unless you can afford to Update all existing copies of the Manuscript, the order
will fail entirely.

## ADVERTISE MANUSCRIPT

```text
AM (Manuscript ID#) (Copies) (Retainer)
```

    Example: AM 6 3 5000

To Advertise for sale 3 copies of Manuscript ID #6 at a minimum of 5,000 Crowns each.

See also Page 35.

Manuscripts of any nature which are in your possession at the start of the turn may be put up for sale on the
Malkahai-operated Open Market and sold to the highest bidder(s). More than one copy of the same Manuscript may be put up
for sale with this order, and you should also specify a retainer - the minimum in Crowns that you'll accept per copy for
sale.

The Manuscripts will not actually leave your possession, but if you later transfer them away or otherwise lose them,
then they will automatically be removed from the Open Market listing as no longer for sale. They will also be removed
when actually sold.

Manuscripts for sale will remain on the Open Market listing for three turns, during which time you may re-perform this
order to increase/decrease the copies for sale on the next turn, or to alter the Retainer. When Manuscripts are sold,
the Malkahai will take an "auctioneer's commission" of 5% of the value of the sale before passing on to you the
remainder. The Malkahai will not reveal who is selling what, nor which tribe purchased any particular Manuscript - but
rumours may sometimes slip out.

## BID FOR MANUSCRIPT

```text
BM (Lot #) (Copies) (Offer)
```

    Example: BM 3 2 5000

To bid for 2 copies of Lot #3 at 5,000 Crowns per copy.

Within each set of Turn Results you will also receive a list of any Manuscripts up to grabs on the Open Market, with
each entry allotted a 'Lot #' for the purpose of bidding. The owner of each Lot will not be revealed. The content of
each Lot will be mentioned (eg. Corn MOK 75%), together with the number of copies for sale and a Retainer (minimum bid)
for each copy. All players in the game would have received identical lists (unless no longer in favour with the Malkahai
for some reason), so it is important to bear in mind that you'll be bidding against everybody else.

Copies of a particular Manuscript will naturally go to the highest bidders for that Lot #. You will be informed if you
were outbid for the last remaining copy, and you may bid only with the cash you have on hand at the very beginning of
the turn.

A successful bid will result in receipt of the Manuscript copy(ies), and if this is a MOK containing Lore higher than
your Researched Level of this Lore, then the first copy will be 'consumed' by tribal scholars and your Researched Level
will increase accordingly (and you may also Upgrade Lore to the higher level, on the same turn). Additional copies will
be added to your tribal Manuscripts Listing, as would any Manuscript not containing one of the twelve Lores.

If you successfully bid for any Manuscript other than a normal MOK (Lores 1-12) then the order is considered a Special
Miscellaneous order and is charged accordingly: this is simply to cover the costs involved in producing the
Supplementary Rules Sheet(s) which invariably accompany the receipt of any Manuscript other than a normal MOK.

## GIVE MANUSCRIPT

```text
GM (Tribe #) (ID #) [Copies]
```

    Example: GM 14 3 2

To transfer 2 copies of Manuscript ID #3 (on your tribal Manuscripts Listing) to Tribe #14.

With this order you may transfer, to any tribe #1-43, a copy of any single Manuscript from your tribal Manuscripts
Listing. Manuscripts may not be transferred to tribes with an ID# higher than 43. If you wish to send more than a single
copy you may utilise the optional fourth parameter [Copies] to indicate any number of copies greater than 1. All
transferred copies will of course immediately disappear from your Manuscripts Listing.

The Malkahai charge a flat rate of 150 Crowns per copy transferred, but if you are transferring anything other than a
normal MOK (containing Lores 1-12) then the order is charged as for a Special Miscellaneous order.

## ANNOUNCE GOVERNMENT

```text
AG (Gov, Type 1-3)
```

Government Types are:

|Code|Meaning|
|---:|-------|
|1|Monarchy|
|2|Despot|
|3|Republic|

    Example: AG 3

To Announce a new Republican form of Government for your tribe.

All tribes begin the game with a Government style of Monarchy, and all rules apply to a Monarchy exactly as stated. A
tribal Warlord may change the Government style only once during his/her lifetime, but each successor may also alter the
current style of Government. Your starting Warlord is assumed to have not yet announced a Government style, so you may
use this order any time from the beginning of the game to change to either Despot or Republic. See page 7 for details of
the differences in Government style.

---

## RELIGIOUS/MAGIC ORDERS

Most Religious/Magic orders have been omitted from this document as they are unable to be used at this stage of the
campaign. The Rule Compendium itself does, however, contain full details of these aspects of the game.

## TRANSFER MYSTICS

```text
ZAA (From Army #) (To Army #) (Mystics)
ZAT (From Army #) (To Town #) (Mystics)
ZAF (From Army #) (To Fort #) (Mystics)
ZAS (From Army #) (To Shrine #) (Mystics)
ZTA (From Town #) (To Army #) (Mystics)
ZFA (From Fort #) (To Army #) (Mystics)
ZSA (From Shrine #) (To Army #) (Mystics)
```

Study the order codes above with the Code Key below, for ease of understanding.

Codes are:

|Code|Meaning|
|---:|-------|
|Z|Transfer Mystics|
|A|Army|
|T|Town or City|
|F|Fort, Gem Mine, or Wizard's Tower|
|S|Shrine|

    Example: ZFA 13 4 25

To transfer 25 Mystics from Fort/Gem Mine/Wizard's Tower #13 to Army #4.

With this order you may transfer Mystics (magic users) from any settlement into any army, or vice versa, which must be
in the same or an adjoining location.

Transfers are enacted before Army Movement.

Mystics are the ordinary magic-users in the campaign and are often religiously inclined, such being the nature of '
magiks' upon Medokh's World. They are not to be confused with Loremasters, Magicians and Sorcerers, who are magic-users
of far greater power than an ordinary Mystic (and who may be hired in the campaign as named Individuals, from the Open
Market for such). Ordinary Mystics will tend to congregate at controlled Tribal Shrines, where they have access to
ancient works of Holy Lore, but the Warlord may at any time call them into the service of the tribe using the above
orders. Mystics are able to cast minor enchantments in defence or offence, so are useful in battle situations, but later
in the campaign they will also possess the ability to 'mind-meld' and work together to create extremely powerful Spell
Rituals, through understanding of The Lesser Mysteries and the mysterious precious Gemstones of Medokh's World.

## GIFT TO THE GODS

```text
GG (God # 1-7) (Crowns) [Tribe #]
```

    Example A: GG 6 5000

To spend 5,000 Crowns on religious ceremonies & festivals dedicated to the Lesser God Ko-Hiaki.

    Example B: GG 6 5000 14

To spend 5,000 Crowns on religious ceremonies intended to God-curse Tribe #14 by putting them in disfavour with the
Lesser God Ko-Hiaki.

List of Gods All tribes begin the campaign in Piety towards Medokh and each of His disciples among the Lesser Gods,
particularly towards the tribe's own race Creator. Your Turn Results will show your tribe's current Piety ratings every
turn, in the form of a graph, with Piety towards each God rated 0-100%. This rating may be assumed to be the percentage
of your tribe who follow the teachings and beliefs of the God in question. Piety is good for morale.

Erecting Shrines (which are dedicated to a specific God) is one of the ways Piety may be gained. The other method
available at the start of the campaign is to use this order, Gift to the Gods, and thereby spend Crowns in lavish
religious ceremonies & festivals, intended to convert more of your people.

Cash spent on ceremonies to God #1, Medokh Himself, will be distributed fairly evenly among worship of all the Lesser
Gods: your Medokh Piety rating cannot itself be increased, it is automatically adjusted to represent your tribe's
overall Piety (but with Piety towards your own Creator weighing the heaviest in this formula) - ie. if you achieve 100%
Piety towards each of the Lesser Gods, your Piety towards Medokh Himself will also be 100%.

This order also features an optional fourth parameter, used for God-cursing another tribe. If you exercise this option
by entering a Tribe # in the fourth parameter (leave blank otherwise), then the Crowns given in the third parameter will
be spent not on increasing your own Piety with the God in question, but in reducing the Piety of the enemy tribe towards
this God. If reduced low enough this would have a detrimental effect on the general morale of your enemy's tribe -
perhaps sufficient for you to win battles more easily, or to cause his people to leave their tribe in search of a better
life elsewhere, thereby reducing or even ruining the enemy's economic prosperity.

God-cursing should not be taken lightly, however, as it may backfire.

## REDEDICATE SHRINE

```text
RD (Shrine #) (New God #)
```

    Example: RD 15 3

To rededicate Shrine #15 to God #3, the Lesser God Elvirius.

With this order an existing controlled Shrine may be rededicated to the worship of a different God, but only if there
are no Blood Guard present, as these dour fanatics would prevent any such impiety occurring. This order is useful for
converting recently-captured enemy Shrines to serving one's own preferred God, who would no doubt be mightily pleased
with such a pious gesture. The displaced God might not be too happy with the idea, though.
