# Military Orders

Most of the orders you'll perform in the campaign will involve the use of Field Armies, and these have therefore been grouped together under the heading of Military Orders. Each Army may perform a single Major order per month (turn), plus any number of minor orders. Major orders are Movement (any form), Training, R & R, Ruin Exploration, Constructing Settlements, Reinforcing Defences, conducting Sieges, and Exploring specific Locations - ie. all the orders which might logically be assumed to be rather time-consuming. All other orders involving armies would not prevent any army from being able to perform its single Major order every turn, nor would they interfere with the performance of any other minor orders by the same army.

---
## NAME ARMY
```
NA (Army #) ---- (New Name)
```

    Example: NA 13 13th Legion of Doom

To name Army #13 the '13th Legion of Doom' The above order may be utilised at any time to personalise your position in the campaign and better reflect your preferences, if any. New armies may be named by you when first mustered, so this order might be useful only for the initial five armies with which you begin the campaign.

---
## MUSTER REGIMENTS
```
MR (Town #) (Amount) [Special 1-5]
```

    Example A: MR 1 10

To muster 10 Guard regiments at Town #1 into the local Garrison.

    Example B: MR 1 10 1

To muster 10 Guard regiments at Town #1 into the local Garrison, and for every Town or City in the same Region as Town #1 to also do this.

    Example C: MR 1 10 2

As above Example B but for ALL controlled Towns and Cities, anywhere in the land, to also try to muster this number of Guard regiments to Garrison.

    Example D: MR 1 10 3

As Example A above (single settlement Muster), but also orders a Feudal Levy at the indicated Town. A Feudal Levy is an instruction to the Town Elders to try to raise as many new Guard regiments as possible. This is usually much more effective than normal Guard increases but will affect the morale of the civilians as their relatives are drafted into the army.

    Example E: MR 1 10 4

As Example B above (Region-wide Mustering), but also orders a Feudal Levy in all of the Towns/Cities within the Region. Morale will suffer accordingly.

    Example F: MR 1 10 5

As Example C above (Empire-wide 'Global' Mustering) but also orders a Feudal Levy in every controlled Town or City in the land. Morale will suffer accordingly, given the urgent 'distress signal' nature of this order. Mustering Guard regiments into Garrison turns said regiments into full-time warriors, with an appropriate increase in maintenance costs and pay. As Garrison troops they may thereafter be formed into a new Field Army, or transferred into an existing one.

## REGIMENT TRANSFERS
```
AA (From Army #) (To Army #) (Regiments)
AT (From Army #) (To Town #) (Regiments)
AF (From Army #) (To Form #) (Regiments)
AS (From Army #) (To Shrine #) (Regiments)
TA (From Town #) (To Army #) (Regiments)
FA (From Fort #) (To Army #) (Regiments)
SA (From Shrine #) (To Army #) (Regiments)
```
Study the order codes above with the Code Key below, for ease of understanding.

Codes Are: A = Army T = Town/City F = Fort/Gem Mine/Tower S = Shrine

    Example: FA 13 4 25

To Transfer 25 Regiments from Frot/Gem Mine/Wizard's Tower #13 to Army #4. Regiments may be transferred between any field army and settlement garrison, if located in the same or an adjoining location at the beginning of the turn. Transfers take place before Army Movement, so regiments may be transferred from a garrison and into an army which subsequently marches away on the same turn, or perhaps between two nearby armies which then march off in opposite directions. Transfers also take place before Sieges and combat in the field. If all the regiments present in an army are transferred into another army or into the garrison of a settlement, then the army from which they were transferred will cease to exist. However, all Mystics and Individuals attached to the Army would also accompany the last regiment transferred out, before the actual cessation of the army in question. Regiments involved in a transfer will suffer a mild loss of fatigue and morale. This is not sufficient to be a problem unless involved in a 'chain transfer' involving multiple transfers on the same turn (as transfer orders are processed in the order in which you list them on the Order Sheet, permitting regiments to be 'passed along a line' but suffering fatigue and morale loss for every such transfer). When regiments are transferred into a different garrison or army their various ratings are averaged with those of the force they've joined - see page .

---
## TRAIN FIELD ARMY
```
TF (Army #) [Blank or 1] [Manuscript]
```

    Example A: TF 1

To train Army #1 in ordinary combat Skill (a rating 0-100%).

    Example B: TF 1 1

To train Army #1 in local Terrain Combat Skill (a rating 0-100%).

    Example C: TF 1 16

To train Army #1 in ordinary combat Skill using an ancient Training MOK, currently listed as number #16 on the tribal Manuscripts Listing.

    Example D: TF 1 1 17

To train Army #1 in local Terrain Combat Skill using an ancient, approriate Training MOK, listed as number #17 on the tribal manuscripts Listing. On war-torn Medokh's World, training cannot safely be undertaken when away from the protective veil of an alert garrison, so Armies may be given Training orders only when located at a controlled Town, City or Military Fortification (not at a Shrine, Gem Mine or Wizard's Tower as the garrisons of these do not send out scouts with which approaching forces might be detected).

Training is a Major order for an Army, which means it cannot perform any other Major order on the same turn. Example A above shows an Army given instructions to train in ordinary combat skills (the 'Experience' rating of 0-100%). A regiment's 'Experience' is a major factor in combat situations. Example B shows an Army given instructions to train in Terrain Combat Skill, meaning the terrain in which it is located at present. If is often advantageous to build Military Fortifications in unfamiliar terrain, where armies may be sent to train for combat in this type of land (as training can take place only if located at a controlled Town, City or Fortification). Every regiment has a Terrain Combat Skill rating for each of its six common types of terrain - Plains, Forest, Hills, Mountains, Forested Hills and Wastelands. The outcome of battles is often greatly affected by the skills of the combatants in the local terrain.

Example C shows an Army given instructions to train in ordinary Combat Skill, but with the addition in the fourth (optional) parameter of a Manuscript ID# taken from the tribal Manuscripts Listing. If used, this must refer to an ancient Training MOK written by some Great Hero of old, detailing campaigns fought and the tactics employed. The use of such MOK would benefit training immensely.

Example D is identical to Example C above, but in this case refers to an ancient Training Mok dealing entirely with combat within a specific type of terrain. For this reason the army must be located at a Town, City or Fort within the required terrain, and must state '1' for Terrain Training in the third parameter of the order space as well as indicate the relevant MOK from the tribal Manuscripts Listing.

---
## TRAIN GARRISON
```
TG (Town #) [Blank or 1] [Manuscript #]
```

    Example A: TG 1

To train the garrison of Town #1 in ordinary combat Skill (a rating 0-100%)/ Example B: TG 1 1

To train the garrison of Town #1 in local Terrain Combat Skill (a rating 0-100%).

    Example C: TG 1 16

To train the garrison of Town #1 in ordinary combat Skill using an ancient Training MOK, currently listed as number #16 on the tribal Manuscripts Listing.

    Example D: TG 1 1 17

To train the garrison of Town #1 in local Terrain Combat Skill using an ancient, appropriate Training MOK, listed as number #17 on the tribal Manuscripts Listing. Training garrisons of Towns and Cities is identical to training Armies, with the sole exception that the order code is TG not TF. All other factors are identical to training Armies and are therefore explained above. Note that the garrisons of Forts, Shrines, Gem Mines and Wizard's Towers may not be issued with training instructions (only the garrisons of Towns & Cities). The duties of such preclude them from having the time available for additional training - such troops should be trained before being assigned to the garrisons of these settlements.

---
## REST & RECUPREATE
```
RR (Type 1-4) (ID #) [Crowns]
```

Types are: 1 = Army 2 = Town/City 3 = Fort/Gem Mine/Wizard's Tower 4 = Shrine

    Example A: RR 1 9

To instruct Army #9 to Rest & Recuperate at their current location.

    Example B: RR 3 5

To instruct the Garrison of Fort/Gem Mine/Wizard's Tower #5 to R & R.

    Example C: RR 1 9 500

To instruct Army #9 to R & R and to share 500 Crowns among them for a job well done. R & R is primarily a morale-boosting order but is also extremely useful as a rest cure for fatigued troops, such as when an army has recently Force Marched and fought a tremendous battle (win or lose). The Garrison of any settlement may also be given a holiday - though naturally they would do so in shifts. R & R for an Army will have more effect if located somewhere that would add meaning to a period off-duty, such as a Shrine or Town. The fourth (optional) parameter of this order also permits you to distribute a reward from the tribal Treasury, to be distributed among the regiments in question. When doing so, resist the temptation to make troops extremely rich (in comparison to normal monthly wages) as doing so might cause desertions - or at the very least have them wondering what nasty job you've got lined up for them - which is the opposite of the desired effect of a sizable morale boost, of course.

---
## SURVEY REGION
```
SR (Army #) ([Blank or 1] [Map Type]
```

Map Types are: Blank = Only Terrain shown, costing 30 Crowns 1 = Terrain & Ruins shown, costing approximately 50 Crowns 2 = Terrain, Ruins & Settlements shown, costing approximately 70 Crowns

    Example A: SR 10

To instruct Army #10 to arrange for a local Economic Survey, but no map is required.

    Example B: SR 10 1

To instruct Army #10 to arrange for a local Economic Survey, together with a map showing the basic geography of the Region.

    Example C: SR 10 1 1

To instruct Army #10 to arrange for a local Economic Survey, together with a map showing the basic geography of the Region as well as location of all the local ancient ruins.

    Example D: SR 10 1 2

To instruct Army #10 to arrange for a local Economic Survey, together with a map showing the basic geography of the Region as well as location of all the local ancient ruins and tribal settlements of any nature. With the above order any Army commander may be instructed to contact local representatives of the mysterious traders of the Malkahai, with a view to receiving a map and Economic Survey of the region in which the Army is currently located. This order takes place before Army Movement. The Economic Survey is used primarily to reveal how many Towns & Cities may be erected in the space available within a particular Region - most Regions being able to accommodate between four and six Towns, in different terrain. However, for a nominal fee the Malkahai are also able to provide a map of the Region is so required, with the options as detailed above ('1' in the third parameter to indicate a map is required, and with a Map Type itself given in the fourth parameter). Note that if a map of any kind is desired, this order will count as a Special Miscellaneous Order. Note that under circumstances will the Malkahai ever reveal the presence of Armies on the map, nor will they reveal the ownership of any settlements present.

---
## PREPARE STRATEGY
```
PS (Army #) (Strategy #1-4) [Retreat%]
```

Strategy Types are: 1 = All Out Attack 2 = Limited Attack 3 = Defend 4 = Fighting Retreat

    Example A: PS 12 1

To order Army #12 to in future employ a battle strategy of All Out Attack.

    Example B: PS 12 2 30

To order Army #12 to in future employ a battle strategy of Limited Attack, but to retreat if victory is not in sight after suffering 30%+ casualties. See page -- for details of the available Battle Strategies. Armies given All Out Attack or Fighting Retreat strategies cannot be allocated a Retreat % threshold: an All Out Attack strategy is do-or-die regardless of casualties (providing morale holds up, of course and Fighting Retreat is an instruction to attempt to avoid battles and casualties if at all possible. In other words, the former has an automatic Retreat % threshold of 100%, the latter a threshold of 0%. Limited Attack and Defend strategies both require a Retreat % threshold, however, and if none is given the default is 50%. Using Limited Attack, the commander will attempt to break off the attack if his casualties pass the Retreat % threshold and victory is not in sight. A commander on Defend will switch to Fighting Retreat should his casualties exceed the Retreat % threshold and the enemy force shows no signs of their attack weakening. However, in both cases the Retreat % threshold is little more than a rough guide and in no circumstances should it be relied upon to get your armies out of trouble.

---
## DECLARE DIPLOMATIC ATTITUDE
```
DD (Tribe #) (Attitude 1-4)
```

Diplomatic Attitudes are: 1 = Allied 2 = Parleying 3 = Neutral 4 = Hostile

Tribe ID's are: 1-42 = Player-controlled tribes 43 = Malkahai 45 = Centaurs 46 = The Drow 47 = Rock Trolls 48 = Ogres 49 = Minotaurs 50 = Dryads 51 = Independent Humans 52 = Ind. Elves 53 = Ind. Dwarves 54 = Ind. Orcs 55 = Ind. Kobolds 56 = Ind. Halflings 57 = Babulska 101 = All Humans 102 = All Elves 103 = All Dwarves 104 = All Orcs 105 = All Kobolds 106 = All Halflings 107 = All 42 player tribes

You cannot change your Diplomatic Attitude towards Tribes not listed above.

    Example A: DD 14 4

To declare your tribe Hostile towards Tribe #14.

    Example B: DD 105 3

To declare your tribe Neutral towards all Kobolds everywhere. See page (13) for a detailed description of Diplomatic Attitudes and the various effects of such.

Note that only a Despot may declare Diplomatic Attitudes with impunity. A Monarchy will suffer morale loss if the people do not agree with the declared Attitudes towards other tribes, and the Warlord of a Republic may not use the DD order at all: the attitude of a Republic towards another tribe will be what the people want it to be, which is determined by Tribal Influence. For detailed information see Government Types on pages (5 & 15).

---
## PAY ARREARS
```
PA (Crowns) [Bonus 1-3]
```

Bonus Types are: 1 = All Field Army Regiments 2 = All Garrison Regiments 3 = All Army & Garrison Regiments

    Example A: PA 5000

To pay regiment wage arrears of 5,000 Crowns.

    Example B: PA 6000 3 To issue a total of 6,000 Crowns in Bonus Wages to all Army & Garrison Regiments.

If at any time you are unable to pay some or all of the wages due to your regular Army & Garrison regiments, this will cause some morale loss and be listed as Arrears - ie. the amount you owe them. Morale will suffer for as long as troops are owed money. This is not immediately deducted on the following turn, however, as to do so might leave the tribe in economic difficulties.

Instead, provision has been made to Pay Arrears when you wish to, using this PA order - simply enter the amount you wish to repay in the second parameter. You may pay some or all of the Arrears with this order. Even when you don't have any arrears to pay, this order is useful for giving bonus wages to all Armies or Garrisons (or both) in general, to boost general morale. To issue bonus wages you use the third (optional) parameter not used when just Paying Arrears, by entering a number 1-3 to indicate among whom the cash bonus should be distributed, as detailed above.

---
## MUSTER ARMY
```
MA (Town #) (Rgts) [Army Name]
```

    Example: MA 2 10 7th Crusaders

To muster a new Army from Town #2, taking 10 Regiments from the Town's Garrison for this purpose, and to name the new army '7th Crusaders'. With this order you may form a new Field Army from the garrison of any Town or City. A newly formed army will be issued the next available ID number for future orders, but cannot be given any orders until the following turn. Using the optional fourth parameter you may name your army if you wish (maximum of 30 characters) but if you leave this blank the army will be given a random name suitable for your race in the campaign. Note that regiments listed in this order are drawn directly from the garrison of the Town or City at which the army is being mustered. The army will have similar skills, but might be of somewhat lower morale for having been forced out of their cozy barracks.

If you neglect to enter the number of regiments to be mustered from the settlement's garrison into the army, then the new army will be mustered with a single regiment (and more may be transferred in on the following turn using order #36 above). Note also that at no time may any tribe control more than fifty Field Armies comprising ordinary, regular tribal regiments.

---
## MUSTER FROM FORT
```
MF (Fort #) (Rgts) [Army Name]
```

    Example: MF 4 12 Hagar's Heathens

To muster a new army in the field using 12 regiments from the garrison of Fort/Gem Mine/Wizard's Tower #4, naming the new army Hagar's Heathens. Mustering a new army from a Fort, Gem Mine or Wizard's Tower with this order is identical in all other details to Mustering from a Town or City as shown above.

---
## MUSTER FROM SHRINE
```
MS (Shrine #) (Rgts) [Army Name]
```

    Example: MS 5 8 Holy Warriors

To muster a new army in the field using 8 regiments from the garrison of Shrine #5, naming the new army Holy Warriors. Mustering a new army from a Shrine with this order is identical in all other details to Mustering from a Town or City as shown above. Note however, that this order applies only to ordinary Garrison regiments - you cannot form new armies using the regiments of fanatical Blood Guard which congregate at certain Shrines.

---
## FORM NEW ARMY
```
FN (Army #) (Rgts) [New Army Name]
```

    Example: FN 6 30 8th Companions

To take 30 regiments from existing Army #6 and form them into a new Army to be named 8th Companions. This order is similar to the above 'muster from settlement' orders, but in this case it is to form a new army from among the ranks of an existing army in the field. Forming a new army with this order does not prevent the existing army from moving or performing any other orders on the same turn, but the newly-created force cannot perform any orders whatsoever - for the remainder of the turn its time will be spent arranging for separate supply lines to be established, and organising its own chain of command. On future turns the two armies are treated entirely separate in every way, although the starting ratings & skills of the new army will of course be identical to those of the army from which it was formed.

---
## DISBAND FIELD REGIMENTS
```
DF (Army #) (Rgts) [Blank or 1]
```

    Example A: DF 7 10

To order Army #7 to disband 10 of its regiments.

    Example B: DF 7 10 1

To order Army #7 to disband 10 of its regiments, but to put the best warriors and leaders from these regiments into one or two superbly-skilled regiments. Disbanding regiments should rarely be an economic necessity, but it can happen that the tribe is unable to continue maintaining large forces in the field, so this order is provided as shown in Example A above. If all regiments are ordered to disband, the army itself will disband.

Disbanding regiments may take place only when the army is located at a Town or City, but will boost both the population of the settlement and its Guard pool.

Example B above shows the use of the (optional) 4th parameter. By entering '1' in this parameter you are still ordering regiments to disband, but in this case giving instructions that the best warriors and officers from these regiments should be formed into a smaller number of highly-skilled regiments.

---
## DISBAND GARRISON REGIMENTS
```
DG (Town #) (Rgts) [Blank or 1]
```

    Example A: DG 7 10

To order Town #7 to disband 10 of its garrison regiments.

    Example B: DG 7 10 1

To order Town #7 to disband 10 of its garrison regiments, but to put the best warriors and leaders from these regiments into one or two superbly-skilled regiments. Disbanding Garrison regiments is identical to Disbanding Field (Army) regiments as shown above, and with this order you may also use the optional fourth parameter to retain the best troops from the disbanded regiments.

---
## EXPLORE RUINS
```
ER (Army #) [Level 1-5] [Rgts]
```

Risk Levels are: 1 = Normal risk/effort (default) 2 = 25% risk/effort 3 = 50% risk/effort 4 = 75% risk/effort 5 = 100% risk/effort

    Example A: ER 5 1

To order Army #5 to Explore the Ancient Ruin at its current location, with just a Normal level of risk & effort. Leaving the fourth parameter blank means the army will use as many regiments as it has available, up to 15.

    Example B: ER 5 3 8

To order Army #5 to Explore the Ancient Ruin at its current location, with 50% more risk & effort than normal, but using only eight of its regiments.

    Example C: ER 5

To order Army #5 to Explore the local ruin, but because a Champion or Master Ranger is present with the Army, this will be a Party Exploration so does not require a risk level in the 3rd parameter or regiments in the 4th parameter. See pages (18-20) for full details on exploration of the ancient ruins of the land, both as a Party Exploration and using Army regiments. If the Army contains either a Champion or a Master Ranger then the exploration will be considered a Party Exploration, otherwise it is automatically an ordinary Army exploration using regiments. Note that an Army must be of Fanatical morale before it will consider actually entering the ancient ruins itself, but there is no such requirement if it is merely accompanying a Party here. If an Army given the Explore Ruin order consists of more than 15 regiments, then only 15 will actually enter the ruin, accompanied by ALL the Mystics and other magic users available. The remaining regiments will stand guard outside. However, if you want fewer than 15 regiments to enter (eg. due to a shortage of Mystics), then you may utilise the vacant 4th parameter of the order to indicate the required number. Exploring Ruins is considered a Major army order (even if just accompanying a Party Exploration), meaning that it cannot perform any other Major order on the same turn.

---
## EXPLORE LOCATION
```
EL (Army #) [Manuscrips ID#]
```

    Example A: EL 3

To order Army #3 to explore its current location, for anything out of the ordinary.

    Example B: EL 3 12

To order Army #3 to explore its current location, using the clues given in Manuscript #12 which gives the army some idea of what it is looking for and where this might be hidden (if in the correct area). This task instructs an Army to scour its current location looking for anything out of the ordinary. Most of the time this would probably prove to be a pointless exercise, but there are exceptions. Firstly there are certain Individuals who may accompany armies and will, when the army performs an EL task, perform their own special task automatically. Such details are provided on relevant Individuals' Supplementary Rules Sheets). Similarly, there may come a time when your tribe possesses a Manuscript which seems to indicate something special being hidden in a certain location. An army performing the EL order in the right location, and armed with the Manuscript in question (identified in the third parameter of the order), would know what it was looking for and would also know where to look for it. Exploring a location is considered a Major army order and will preclude the army from performing any other Major order on the same turn.

---
## SIEGE TOWN
```
ST (Army #) (Direction 1-7) (Type 1-5)
```

    Example A: ST 3 1 4

To order Army #3 to besiege the Town/City immediately to its north, surrounding it and digging in with the intention of starving it into surrender, aiming to capture it intact.

    Example B: ST 3 4 5

To order Army #3 to besiege the Town/City to its south, attacking immediately and assaulting the defences ferociously, aiming to overwhelm the garrison swiftly and without mercy, and then sack the settlement and raze it to the ground.

Directions are: 1 = Settlement to the north 2 = Settlement to the north-east 3 = Settlement to the south-east 4 = Settlement to the south 5 = Settlement to the south-west 6 = Settlement to the north-west 7 = Settlement on the same location

Siege Types are: 1 = Raid the settlement & outlying dwellings rather than actually besiege it, aiming to capture stockpiles & valuables and destroy what it's not possible to carry away. The garrison may sally forth against a weak raiding force. 2 = Hold the settlement to ransom, suggesting that if they throw out their valuables you might go away. A weakly-defended settlement or one of fairly low morale might just take the chance that your army will do so - or it may even open its gates and surrender immediately. 3 = Besiege the settlement with the intention of capturing it intact, and assaulting the gates & walls daily until it surrenders as a result of losses inflicted, or is captured by assault. This may occur very quickly with a powerful army against weak defences, and if hopelessly outnumbered it is possible the garrison may surrender without a fight. 4 = Besiege the settlement with the intention of capturing it intact, but dig in and starve it out in order to minimise your own casualties. This is really only a practical option if you have reason to believe that no large relieving force will be appearing, as your force has to spread out to literally surround the besieged settlement. 5 = Besiege the settlement with the intention of sacking it and razing it to the ground as quickly as possible and regardless of casualties taken. This type of siege often comes as a surprise and is capable of swiftly overwhelming the defenders with sheer ferocity, but the costs can be high as no mercy is given or expected - by either side. Any of the siege options may result in captured goods and Lore if successful, and if the settlement itself is captured it will appear on your Turn Results as controlled by your tribe. A conquered town or city could later be colonised by your tribe. If a settlement does not immediately surrender your army will need to perform the ST order again next turn to continue the siege, but you may then take the opportunity to change the tactics used if you so wish.

Besieging settlements of any nature is considered a Major army order, and doing so would prevent the army from being able to perform any other Major orders on the same turn.

---
## SIEGE FORT
```
SF (Army #) (Direction 1-7) (Type 1-5)
```

    Example: SF 5 6 3

To order Army #5 to besiege the Fort/Gem Mine/Wizard's Tower to the north-west, assaulting the gate & walls with the intention of capturing the settlement intact. The SF order is identical to the ST order detailed above with the sole exception that the RAID option cannot be used with these settlement types.

---
## SIEGE SHRINE
```
SS (Army #) (Direction 1-7) (Type 1-5
```

    Example: SS 5 6 3

To order Army #5 to besiege the Shrine to the north-west, assaulting the gate & walls with the intention of capturing the settlement intact. The SS order is identical to the ST order detailed above with the sole exception that the RAID option cannot be used with these settlement types. Note that ordering the siege of a Shrine dedicated to a God to which your own people have Piety will result in loss of Army morale regardless of the outcome of the siege.

---
## CONSTRUCT TOWN
```
CT (Army #) [Fort Lvl] [New Town Name]
```

    Example: CT 9 3 New Haven

To order Army #9 to construct a new Town at its current location, reinforce its defences to level 3.0, and to name it New Haven. See the rules on Towns discussed on pages (15 & 16), particularly as regards Town Sites. New settlements are erected with a fortification level of 2.0 included in the construction costs, but using the optional 3rd parameter of the order space you may instruct the Army to build larger defences if any additional regiments are available: see your Race Card for details of minimum regiment requirments for constructing settlements, as well as for how much each spare regiment could increase the fortification level by if the materials are available. You must also name your new town using the 4th parameter. Constructing settlements of any type is considered a Major army order and would therefore prevent the army from performing any other Major order on the same turn.

---
## CONSTRUCT FORT
```
CF (Army #) [Fort Lvl] [Rgts]
```

    Example: CF 9 3 20

To order Army #9 to construct a new Military Fortification at its current location, reinforce its defences to level 3.0, and to transfer in 20 regiments to act as future garrison. See the section on Military Fortifications on page (16), as well as your Race Reference card, for details on the build costs & regiment requirements for constructing new Military Fortifications.M

---
## CONSTRUCT SHRINE
```
CS (Army #) [Fort Lvl] [God #]
```

    Example: CS 9 3 7

To order Army #9 to construct a new Shrine at its current location, reinforce its defences to level 3.0, and to dedicate the Shrine to the worship of God #7, the Lesser God of Harusang.

Gods for Dedicating Shrines to are: 1 = Medokh 2 = Halkurinai 3 = Elvirius 4 = Dunhaladeen 5 = Oricglume 6 = Ko-Hiaki 7 = Harusang See the section on Shrines on page (17), as well as your Race Reference Card, for details on the build costs & regiment requirements for constructing new Shrines.

---
## REINFORCE TOWN
```
RT (Army #) (Fort Lvl) (Rgts)
```

    Example: RT 4 8.5 10

To order Army #4 to improve defences of the local Town to Fort Level 8.5 and to transfer in 10 Regiments from the army to serve as additional Garrison in the Town in future.

Each regiment in the army may erect additional defences according to both the materials available and its 'build strength', which varies from race to race: see the section entitled Reinforcing Defences on your Race Reference Card for further details. The army must be located on the same location as the settlement at the start of the turn. Note that the regiment transfer takes place after the reinforcement work is complete, so if they fit you may if you wish transfer the entire reinforcing army into the Town to act as additional Garrison in future. If all of the regiments are transferred out of an army it will cease to exist. A Town may be fortified up to level 12.0.

---
## REINFORCE FORT
```
RF (Army #) (Fort Lvl) (Rgts)
```

    Example: RF 4 7.5 10

To order Army #4 to improve defences of the local Fort/Gem Mine/Wizard's Tower to Fort level 7.5, and to transfer in 10 Regiments from the army to serve as additional Garrison in the settlement in future. Details as per RT above. See the section entitled Reinforcing Defences on your Race Reference Card. A Military Fortification may be fortified up to level 8.

---
## REINFORCE SHRINE
```
RS (Army #) (Fort Lvl) (Rgts)
