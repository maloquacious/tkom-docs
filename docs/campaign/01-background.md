# Background

## Campaign Background in brief
Medokh was greatest of the Elder Gods before Mazdrak of the One Eye, Lord of the Netherworld, cast Him from the Hall of the Gods with the aid of the terrible Orb of Eternal Night.
Then did Mazdrak and His Lords of Chaos descend upon Medokh's World and lay it to waste, scattering Medokh's faithful disciples, the Lesser Gods, and slaughtering His people during the Great Wars of Chaos which then ensued and continued to rage over the next five centuries.

Medokh was bound and cast into limbo, sealed there for eternity behind a Great Door locked with Seven Keys of Power, forged by the Chaos Lords using arcane rituals of the terrible Elder Magiks.
The Keys were then scattered about the land and hidden from sight, protected by evil spells and fould creatures of the Netherworld.

Some seven hundred years ago the Great Wars of Chaos came to an abrupt ending.

Mazdrak and his immortal minions among the Chaos Lords had departed Medokh's World to attend to a revolt against their rule by others among the Elder Gods.

Medokh's faithful disciples, His Lesser Gods, had then grown in power and strength during Mazdrak's absence from the land, and had created new races to replace those slaughtered during the Great Wars.

The new races to the land are immune to the effects of Elder Magiks and cannot be harmed directly by such, unlike the Lesser Gods or any other entity which existed before the Great Wars.
These new races were created for the purpose of seeking out and destroying the hidden Keys of Power, in order that Holy Medokh might be freed to once again combat Chaos and regain His rightful place in the Hall of the Gods.
